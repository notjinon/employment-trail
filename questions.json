      "question": "Throwback. A sunny day in August 2019. Your first day of High School. Middle School was a tumultuous place, but transferring to a new district gives you the capital necessary to start on a clean slate. Time and time again, you’ve heard from your parents, older relatives, and teachers that this is the time to find out who you really are.\n\nWho are you?",

With the phantom of your own persona haunting you, you know taking a gap year or going to a Community College isn’t an option. Thus, to broaden your horizons, you accept your parent’s offer to go on a set of campus visits.\n\nThe question is, where?",
